0,Can you explain the doctrine of stare decisis in common law?,0,False,"Stare decisis is a foundational principle in common law systems where courts follow previously decided cases when the same legal issues arise. It promotes consistency, predictability, and stability in judicial decisions. Higher court rulings bind lower courts, and courts generally avoid overturning precedent unless there is a strong justification.",1.446895091999977,1.0,"The doctrine of stare decisis is a fundamental principle in common law systems, which requires courts to follow the precedents set by higher courts within the same jurisdiction. The term 'stare decisis' is Latin for 'to stand by things decided.' This doctrine ensures consistency, predictability, and stability in the application of the law. 

In practice, stare decisis means that when a court has made a decision on a particular issue, that decision should be followed in future cases with similar facts and issues. This doctrine operates within a hierarchical court system, where decisions of higher courts (such as supreme courts or courts of appeal) are binding on lower courts. 

There are two main types of stare decisis:

1. **Vertical stare decisis**: This refers to the binding effect of decisions from higher courts on lower courts within the same jurisdiction. For example, the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are binding on all lower federal courts and state courts.

2. **Horizontal stare decisis**: This refers to the persuasive effect of decisions from courts of equal jurisdiction. While not strictly binding, decisions from courts of equal standing can be influential in shaping the law.

The doctrine of stare decisis serves several important functions:

- **Predictability**: It allows individuals and businesses to anticipate the likely outcome of legal disputes based on past cases.
- **Consistency**: It ensures that similar cases are treated similarly, promoting fairness and justice.
- **Efficiency**: It reduces the need for repetitive litigation and allows courts to focus on novel or complex issues.

However, the doctrine is not absolute. Courts may depart from precedent under certain circumstances, such as:

- **If the precedent was incorrectly decided**: If a court believes that a previous decision was based on flawed reasoning or a misunderstanding of the law.
- **If there are significant changes in societal conditions**: If changes in society or the law render the precedent outdated or inappropriate.
- **If there is a need for judicial development of the law**: In areas where the law is unclear or evolving, courts may need to revisit and adapt previous decisions.

Overall, the doctrine of stare decisis is a cornerstone of common law systems, promoting stability and consistency while allowing for flexibility and evolution in the law.",False,

Biased reporting can lead to a skewed understanding of facts, creating an uneven playing field for policymakers. This can result in policies that cater to the interests of specific groups rather than the broader public. For instance, if news outlets consistently portray a certain group in a negative light, it can create a public perception that may not align with reality, ultimately influencing policy decisions that impact that group.

It is a critical check on the powers of the executive and legislative branches, ensuring they act within their legal authority and in accordance with the Constitution. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Grounds for Review**: A party must have a valid reason to challenge the decision, such as an error of law, abuse of discretion, or violation of constitutional rights.

2. **Filing a Petition**: The party seeking review files a petition with the appropriate court, typically an appellate or supreme court.

3. **Review Process**: The court reviews the decision based on the petition, the record from the lower body, and legal arguments from both sides.

4. **Decision**: The court can uphold, reverse, or remand (send back) the decision. If the court finds the decision unlawful, it may order the agency or lower court to reconsider.

5. **Precedent and Impact**: Judicial review decisions set legal precedents, influencing future cases and guiding government actions.

This process varies by jurisdiction, but it remains a cornerstone of the rule of law and constitutional governance.",False,

12,How do elections in parliamentary democracies differ from presidential ones?,0,False,"In parliamentary democracies, the executive derives legitimacy from the legislature and remains accountable to it. In presidential systems, the president is directly elected and holds separate authority from the legislature. Parliamentary systems often enable faster legislative action, while presidential systems provide stronger executive independence.",1.755679389999841,1.0,"Elections in parliamentary democracies and presidential democracies differ in several key aspects. In parliamentary democracies, the head of government is typically a prime minister or chancellor who is accountable to the legislature (parliament). The party or coalition with the most seats in parliament usually forms the government, and the leader of that party or coalition becomes the head of government. 

In contrast, presidential democracies have a president who serves as both the head of state and head of government. The president is directly elected by the people and is not accountable to a legislature in the same way a prime minister is. 

Some of the main differences include: 

1. **Head of Government Selection:** In parliamentary systems, the head of government emerges from the legislature, while in presidential systems, the head of government (president) is directly elected.

2. **Separation of Powers:** Presidential systems often have a clear separation of powers between the executive (led by the president), the legislative, and the judicial branches. In parliamentary systems, there is a fusion of powers between the executive and legislative branches.

3. **Accountability:** In parliamentary systems, the executive (led by the prime minister) must maintain the confidence of the legislature and can be removed through a vote of no confidence. In presidential systems, the president has a fixed term and can be removed through impeachment or other constitutional processes.

4. **Election Focus:** Elections in parliamentary systems often focus on the parties and their platforms, while presidential elections focus on the candidates for president.

16,Explain the concept of judicial activism.,0,False,Judicial activism refers to situations where courts take a more proactive role in policymaking by interpreting laws broadly or filling legislative gaps. Courts may invoke activism to protect fundamental rights or address public issues when other branches fail to act.,0.8505337040000995,1.0,"Judicial activism refers to the practice of judges interpreting the law in a way that goes beyond the literal meaning of the statutes and precedents, often to advance a particular social or political agenda. This can involve striking down laws or government actions as unconstitutional, or interpreting laws in a broad or narrow way to achieve a desired outcome. Judicial activism is often contrasted with judicial restraint, where judges take a more limited role and defer to the other branches of government.

However, implementation has been slow, and challenges remain, such as inconsistent enforcement at state levels and continued retaliation against whistleblowers."
19,Explain freedom of speech vs hate speech under the US First Amendment.,0,False,"The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, including offensive or disagreeable ideas. However, it does not protect incitement to imminent lawless action, true threats, or harassment. Hate speech is protected unless it directly provokes violence or constitutes targeted intimidation.",1.2307769470003223,0.5,"In the United States, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, which generally allows individuals to express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas without government interference. However, the concept of hate speech has sparked debates about the limits of free speech. 

The First Amendment states, 'Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.' But, the Supreme Court has established that not all speech is protected. Hate speech, which targets individuals or groups based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, can be considered as falling outside the realm of protected speech in certain contexts. 

The key Supreme Court case on this issue is Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), which ruled that speech is not protected if it incites imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. For hate speech to be considered unprotected, it must be directed towards and likely to incite violence against a specific group. 

The line between protected speech and unprotected hate speech can be blurry. Public debates, academic discussions, and artistic expressions are generally protected, even if they include controversial or offensive ideas. On the other hand, speech that directly threatens or incites violence against specific individuals or groups may cross the line.

It's also important to note that private institutions, like social media platforms and employers, can set their own policies regarding speech, which may differ from the legal standards set by the First Amendment.",False,

Non-money bills are bills that do not involve expenditure or appropriation of revenue. In the Indian parliamentary system, the Rajya Sabha has the power to initiate, consider, and pass non-money bills. 

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Introduction**: A member of the Rajya Sabha introduces the bill in the House.
2. **Referral to a Committee**: The bill is referred to a parliamentary committee for examination and report. The committee may hold hearings, gather information, and make recommendations.
3. **Discussion and Debate**: The bill is then discussed and debated in the Rajya Sabha. Members may propose amendments to the bill.
4. **Voting**: After debate, the bill is put to vote. If a majority of members present and voting approve the bill, it is passed.
5. **Transmission to Lok Sabha**: If the bill originated in the Rajya Sabha, it is transmitted to the Lok Sabha (the lower house) for its consideration.
6. **Joint Sittings**: If the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha disagree on the bill, a joint sitting of both Houses may be convened to resolve the differences.

In the legislative process, the Rajya Sabha has equal powers with the Lok Sabha in respect of non-money bills, except in the case of a money bill which can only originate in the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha's participation ensures that the interests of the states and the upper house are represented in the legislative process.",False,
