His dramatic rise in the early 1990s, in the wake of the Mandal Commission and the Ram Mandir movement, has often been portrayed as the defining moment when the \u201cmarginalised&quot; finally found their representation.\\n\\nBut a closer look at Bihar\u2019s political history reveals that this belief is more myth than fact. Political empowerment of disadvantaged groups in Bihar did not begin with Lalu \u2013 it was a reality long before he emerged on the scene.\\n\\nA DEEPER HISTORY OF REPRESENTATION\\n\\nThe story of Bihar\u2019s leadership is filled with examples of disadvantaged communities reaching the top. BP Mandal, who gave his name to the Mandal Commission, was an OBC chief minister. Bhola Paswan Shastri and Ram Sundar Das \u2013 both Dalits, led the state. Daroga Prasad Rai, another OBC, occupied the chair. Abdul Ghafoor, a Muslim, served as state chief minister. Karpoori Thakur, from the Nai (barber) community, is remembered as the first to implement OBC reservations in Bihar.\\n\\nEven nationally, Bihar\u2019s Jagjivan Ram was one of India\u2019s tallest Dalit leaders, serving in multiple Union governments and coming close to becoming Prime Minister. This history shows that marginalised communities were neither silent nor absent in Bihar\u2019s political leadership before Lalu. Their voices were already part of the state\u2019s democratic churn.\\n\\nSOCIAL JUSTICE WAVE BEFORE LALU\\n\\nThe 1960s and 1970s were marked by churns that set the stage for backward empowerment. Old-timers in Patna still recall how Karpoori Thakur\u2019s reservation move split college campuses in the 1970s, but he emerged as a Bihari leader fighting for OBC cause gained national prominence. The Mandal Commission, chaired by BP Mandal in the late 1970s, laid the groundwork for a nationwide reconfiguration of politics. By 1990, when Lalu Prasad Yadav became chief minister, Bihar was already primed for a politics of social justice.\\n\\nLalu did not invent backward representation; what he did was reframe it. His politics brought energy, symbolism, and rhetoric, but also concentrated benefits in narrower channels.\\n\\nTHE YADAV-CENTRIC CONSOLIDATION\\n\\nThe critical change under Lalu was the consolidation of political power around one sub-group: the Yadavs. With about 14 per cent of Bihar\u2019s population, Yadavs became the backbone of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Over time, the party\u2019s identity fused with theirs.\\n\\nFor non-Yadav OBCs (who, along with EBCs, make up 52-55 per cent of Bihar\u2019s population), Dalits (15 per cent), and Muslims (14 per cent), the RJD offered political rhetoric but limited leadership opportunities. The irony was clear: while invoking the language of empowerment, Lalu\u2019s model restricted the scope of who could rise to the top. Nearly 84 per cent of Bihar\u2019s society was effectively locked out of the chief minister\u2019s chair under RJD\u2019s structure.\\n\\nMuslims, though crucial as a loyal vote bloc, saw little elevation to chief ministerial or deputy chief ministerial roles. The RJD\u2019s model of representation was therefore less inclusive than its slogans suggested.\\n\\nTHE NDA\u2019S COUNTER-EXAMPLE\\n\\nContrast this with the NDA\u2019s record. While the BJP-JD(U) alliance has been no stranger to caste arithmetic, it has experimented more broadly with leadership. When Nitish Kumar stepped aside in 2014, Jitan Ram Manjhi, a Mahadalit from the Musahar community, was elevated as chief minister. Symbolic as it was, such a move would have been inconceivable under RJD.\\n\\nNitish Kumar\u2019s own political career also reflects coalition-building across caste lines-Kurmis, EBCs, Mahadalits, and even women have been drawn into his schemes of governance and welfare. While the NDA has its limitations, its leadership experiments have ensured that Bihar\u2019s top post is not permanently tied to one caste identity.\\n\\nWHY THIS MATTERS IN 2025\\n\\nAs Bihar heads into the 2025 assembly elections, the debate over representation is central once again. RJD projects itself as the authentic voice of the marginalised. Yet its leadership remains tightly controlled by one family and one caste bloc.\\n\\nTejashwi Yadav, inheriting his father\u2019s mantle, embodies both continuity and constraint. His appeal to youth and his promise of jobs have made him a powerful challenger, but he has shown little inclination to broaden RJD\u2019s leadership beyond Yadav dominance. For Muslims, Dalits, and non-Yadav OBCs, RJD remains more a platform for participation as voters than as power-holders.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Nitish Kumar, despite his many shifts in alliances, has cultivated a politics of accommodation. His elevation of Manjhi, his outreach to EBCs and Mahadalits through welfare schemes, and his reliance on coalition governance suggest a willingness \u2013 however tactical \u2013 to share representation. For the BJP, the emphasis has been on consolidating non-Yadav OBCs and Dalits, positioning itself as the counter to RJD\u2019s Yadav-Muslim base.\\n\\nTHE REAL CHOICE FOR BIHAR\\n\\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\\n\\nThe upcoming election, therefore, is not just about which leader delivers jobs or welfare. It is about which model of representation Bihar chooses. Will it remain bound to the myth of Lalu as the singular voice of the marginalised-a myth that has in practice narrowed representation? Or will it move toward a more pluralistic distribution of leadership, reflecting the full diversity of Bihar\u2019s society?\\n\\nBihar\u2019s politics has always been about more than arithmetic. It is about aspiration \u2013 the desire of every community to see itself at the centre of power. That aspiration began long before Lalu and will continue long after him. The 2025 verdict will decide whether Bihar remains trapped in the politics of one bloc\u2019s dominance or takes a step toward genuinely inclusive leadership.\\n\\nAbout the Author Anindya Banerjee Anindya Banerjee, Associate Editor brings over fifteen years of journalistic courage to the forefront.
